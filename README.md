# MPCS 52553 - Web Development - Spring 2024

This repository is a living repository.  

Each week, additional notes and code will be added here.

Start by cloning this repository ONCE to your laptop (`git clone` or similar).

If you want to code along (highly recommended), you have two options.

**If you are very comfortable with Git, do this at the start of each lecture:**

1. Change the current branch to `main`
2. Get the latest code (`git pull origin main` from Terminal or shell, or use your IDE)
3. Create a branch for the current week and switch to it (example: `git switch -c week1`)
4. At the end of class, commit your changes.

*Super advanced version*: instead of creating a new branch every week, create just one branch for your code `git checkout -b mycode`.  Each week, get the latest code on `main`, rebase your `mycode` branch against main, then switch back to the `mycode` branch to code along during class.  Be sure to commit your code on the `mycode` branch at the end of each week.

**If you are NOT too comfortable with Git, do this at the start of each week:**

1. Use the Terminal or your IDE to "pull" the latest changes from the `lectures` repository.
2. Copy this week's folder into a new folder AWAY from your lectures folder so that it is NOT in a child folder or subdirectory.
3. Open that new folder in your favorite editor and code there, keeping the original `lectures` folder unchanged.
