## Notes

**Course in General**

* Homework is due BEFORE ARRIVING for class on that date.
* Quizzes must be taken BEFORE ARRIVING for class on that date.
* This class contains occasional video lessons to be watched outside of class. Classroom sessions will generally average 2 hours instead of the usual 3, but actual class time will vary from week to week.
* I really try to avoid assigning any "busy work."  However, simply understanding some theory isn't sufficient for a hands-on endeavor like web development. Practice is important. I therefore depend on you to think of your own coding exercices as well as what I may require. Research the details, boundary conditions, and edge cases around any given topic.
* Office hours are for anything that's helpful to you: questions about the class, homework assignments, general career advice, or discussion of your favorite movies.
* If you miss a homework deadline, you do NOT need to ask for an extension; you will simply lose 1 point per day late.  If personal circumstances interfere with completing an assignment on time (illness, etc) PLEASE let me know and I will be HAPPY to work something out.

**Today**

* HTML is a markup language, intended to provide "semantics" (meaning) to otherwise plain text.
* Browsers are very forgiving: they can display most HTML content even if the HTML document isn't technically a "valid" document.
* Be sure to get familiar with the [W3C Document Validator service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

* Browsers interpret and execute HTML line by line, from top to bottom of the file. If it were a programming language, it would be an imperative one.
* Learn to use your browser's "View Source" and "Inpect" facilities.
* The "web" started as a way to share documents between institutions by "hyperlinking" them together.
* Mosaic was the first "graphical" web browser, developed at the University of Illinois.
* Historically, browsers can only interpret three languages: HTML, CSS, and JS.
* HTTP has historically been the only network protocol for the web. 
* HTTP 1.1, the most common implementation of HTTP today, is a completely plain-text protocol.  It's easy to write HTTP client and servers in any language.  A Python example of a very simple HTTP server can be studied in the file `server_1.py`.
* A newer approach to client-server web communucation, called "WebSockets", provides an interesting alternative. 
* A fourth browser language, WebAssembly, is under development but is not yet fully implemented.
